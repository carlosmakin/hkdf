## HKDF ðŸ”‘

### Overview

This Dart repository implements the HMAC-based Key Derivation Function (HKDF) as defined in [RFC 5869](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5869). HKDF is a key derivation mechanism used to generate strong cryptographic keys from weaker input key material (IKM), suitable for a wide range of cryptographic applications.

### HKDF

HKDF combines a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) with an extraction and expansion process, ensuring the generation of strong, high-entropy keys. It's highly adaptable and secure, making it an excellent choice for various key derivation needs.

#### Key Features:
- **Robust Security**: Resistant to common cryptographic attacks, ensuring the generation of secure keys.
- **Flexibility**: Suitable for a variety of applications, offering customizable key derivation.
- **Configurable Hash Function**: Can be used with different hash functions to fit specific security requirements.

#### Best Practices:
- Utilize a cryptographically strong hash function.
- Employ a non-empty salt for improved security, particularly when the quality of the input key material is in question.

### Background and History

HKDF, as standardized in RFC 5869, is a straightforward yet effective tool for cryptographic key derivation, built on the principles of HMAC-based extraction and expansion of keys.

### RFC 5869

RFC 5869 details the implementation, usage, and security considerations for HKDF, promoting its consistent and secure application in cryptographic systems.

## Usage Examples

### Real-World Use Case: Secure Key Derivation

**Scenario**: Generating a strong encryption key from a password.

```dart
import 'dart:typed_data';
import 'package:hkdf/hkdf.dart';

Uint8List password = ...; // User-provided password
Uint8List salt = ...; // A unique salt
Uint8List info = ...; // Optional application-specific information

// Extract phase
Uint8List prk = HKDF.extract(sha256, password, salt);

// Expand phase
Uint8List strongKey = HKDF.expand(sha256, prk, 32, info);

// Use strongKey for cryptographic purposes
```

### Real-World Use Case: Establishing a Secure Channel

**Scenario**: Deriving keys for secure communication in a client-server model.

```dart
import 'dart:typed_data';
import 'package:hkdf/hkdf.dart';

Uint8List sharedSecret = ...; // Shared secret from a key exchange protocol
Uint8List salt = ...; // A unique salt
Uint8List info = ...; // Optional application-specific information

// Extract phase
Uint8List prk = HKDF.extract(sha256, sharedSecret, salt);

// Expand phase to derive specific keys
Uint8List encryptionKey = HKDF.expand(sha256, prk, 32, info);

// Use encryptionKey for encrypting communication
```
